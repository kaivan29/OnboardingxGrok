# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Calculator Application

This chapter provides an overview of the simple calculator application, its purpose, and how the codebase is structured. The application demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, circle calculations, and includes features like calculation history. It serves as an educational example of modular Python programming, separating concerns into core logic, utilities, and a main entry point.

### Application Purpose

The app is a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power), calculates circle properties (area and circumference), and maintains a history of operations. It's designed for demonstration and learning.


### Codebase Structure

The codebase consists of three main modules: calculator.py for core logic, utils.py for helper functions, and main.py as the entry point. This modular structure promotes reusability and separation of concerns.
