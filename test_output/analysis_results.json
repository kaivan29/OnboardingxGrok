  "summary": "### Codebase Summary\n\n#### 1. What the Project Does\nThis is a simple Python-based calculator application designed for demonstrating basic arithmetic operations and geometric calculations. It serves as a demo tool that performs calculations like addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, computes circle area and circumference, tracks a history of operations, and includes utility functions for number formatting and list processing. The project is educational and lightweight, with a command-line interface for running examples.\n\n#### 2. Main Technologies and Frameworks Used\n- **Language**: Python (standard library usage, no external frameworks).\n- **Modules**: \n  - `math` (for mathematical functions like `pow` and `pi`).\n  - `typing` (for type hints, e.g., `List[float]`).\n- No third-party libraries or frameworks are involved; it's pure Python code.\n\n#### 3. Overall Architecture\nThe codebase follows a modular, object-oriented design with separation of concerns:\n- **Entry Point**: `main.py` acts as the main script, importing and orchestrating components to run a demo.\n- **Core Logic**: `calculator.py` contains the `Calculator` class (for arithmetic operations and history tracking) and standalone functions (for circle calculations).\n- **Utilities**: `utils.py` provides helper functions for formatting, validation, and aggregation.\n- **Structure**: 3 files, 1 class, and 7 functions. It's flat and easy to extend, with no complex dependencies or patterns like MVC.\n\n#### 4. Key Features and Capabilities\n- **Basic Arithmetic**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation via the `Calculator` class, with error handling (e.g., division by zero).\n- **History Tracking**: Maintains a log of calculations, retrievable or clearable.\n- **Geometric Calculations**: Computes circle area and circumference using the `math` module.\n- **Utilities**: Includes functions for number formatting (to specified decimals), positive value validation, summing lists, and calculating averages.\n- **Demo Interface**: Command-line output in `main.py` showcases features with sample inputs and results.\n- **Extensibility**: Simple design allows easy addition of new operations or utilities without major refactoring.",
